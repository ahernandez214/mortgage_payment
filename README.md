This static web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calculates the monthly mortgage payment for a fixed-rate mortgage.
The application should allow users to input the principal amount and the annual interest rate as a percentage. Users should also be able to select the mortgage term from three 
options: 10 years, 15 years, or 30 years. All user inputs must be validated. The calculated monthly payment should be displayed to two decimal places.
The calculation should use the following formula:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{P \times r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}} \]
where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 1200), and \( n \) is the total number of monthly payments (years multiplied by 12).
